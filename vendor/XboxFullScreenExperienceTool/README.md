A lightweight and secure one-click utility designed to enable **Windows 11’s hidden Xbox full screen gaming experience** (also known as **"Xbox Mode"** in recent Windows builds).
This tool automates all underlying configurations, providing a seamless, console-like interface optimized for gamepads.

## 🎮 Full Handheld vs. Limited PC Xbox Mode

Microsoft has recently rolled out a **limited PC edition** of Xbox Mode (Full Screen Experience) to regular PCs. This edition is **missing key features** required for a true console-like experience:

| Feature | Full Handheld Xbox Mode | Limited PC Xbox Mode |
|---|---|---|
| `Choose home app` setting | ✅ Available | ❌ Missing |
| Auto-launch home app on startup | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not supported |
| Default rollout target | Handhelds | Regular PCs |

This tool's purpose is to enable the **Full Handheld** edition on any PC, unlocking the home-app selection and auto-launch behavior that the Limited PC edition lacks.

> 💡 If you use a custom home app such as **[OmniConsole](https://8bit2qubit.github.io/omniconsole-site/)**, the Full Handheld edition is required.
>
> 🚀 **OmniConsole** boots straight into any gaming platform — Steam Big Picture, Xbox, Epic, Armoury Crate SE, Playnite, or anything you add.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

This tool is compatible with **Windows 11 24H2 builds `26100.7019` or later**. If your system does not meet this requirement, the tool will display an error and exit.

> ### **How to Read Build Numbers (Important!)**
>
> When checking the version, **please look at the main build number (before the dot)**. The number _after_ the dot is just a minor update revision.
>
> ### **Native Experience (Recommended)**
>
> _Native support. For Desktops & Laptops, does not rely on screen dimensions override via PhysPanelCS / PhysPanelDrv._
>
> - `26100.8328` or later
> - `26200.8328` or later
> - `26220.7271` or later
> - `26300.7674` or later
> - `28020.1362` or later
>
> ### **Legacy Experience**
>
> - `26100.7019` ~ `26100.8327`
> - `26200.7015` ~ `26200.8327`
> - `28000.1450` or later
>
> **Example:** A build like `26100.1` is **NOT** compatible because its revision `.1` is lower than the required `.7019`. If you are on build 26100 / 26200, please run Windows Update to get the latest version.
>
> 📜 On Legacy builds, Desktop PCs and Laptops use a screen dimensions override — see [Backward Compatibility (Legacy Builds)](#-backward-compatibility-legacy-builds).

Please verify your Windows build version before downloading.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This process consists of preparing your system with the tool, updating apps, and finally enabling the feature in Windows Settings.

### 1. Prepare Your System

1.  Download the latest `.msi` package from the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/8bit2qubit/XboxFullScreenExperienceTool/releases/latest).
2.  Run the installer (administrator privileges required).
3.  Launch the tool from the desktop shortcut.
4.  Click the **“Enable Xbox Mode (FSE)”** button.
5.  Accept the system restart confirmation prompt.
6.  The tool will verify your environment. If no physical touchscreen is detected, you will be prompted to select "Yes" to enable touch simulation. This ensures you can use your controller to operate the on-screen virtual keyboard (Gamepad Keyboard) properly. **Your PC will restart automatically** to apply all changes.

### 2. Update Core Apps

1.  After restarting, launch the tool again.
2.  Click the **"Check MS Store for Xbox Updates"** button (or manually open Microsoft Store > **Downloads** or **Library**).
3.  Click **"Check for updates"** within the Store to refresh all apps. Make sure **Xbox** and **Xbox Game Bar** are fully updated.
    > 🔄 You may need to run "Check for updates" **twice** to ensure everything is fully installed.

### 3. Activate Xbox Mode / Full Screen Experience

1.  Click the **"Open Xbox Mode (FSE) Settings"** button in the tool (or navigate to **Start → Settings → Gaming → Xbox mode / Full screen experience**).
2.  Set "Choose home app" to **Xbox**.
    - If this option is missing, return to "Update Core Apps" and ensure the apps are fully updated.
3.  Enable **"Enter Xbox mode on startup" / "Enter full screen experience on startup"**.

### 4. Enter Xbox Mode (FSE)

Once activated, you can enter Xbox Mode (FSE) in two ways:

1.  **Manually** – via one of these entries:
    - Open Task View and click **Xbox mode (FSE)**.
    - Open the Xbox app and click the **Xbox mode (FSE)** entry.
2.  **On startup** – Boots directly into Xbox Mode (FSE) (requires the startup setting in step 3 above to be enabled).

### **How to Revert**

1.  Run the tool again and click **“Disable & Restore”**.
2.  **Restart your PC** to complete the process.

> 💡 To completely remove this tool, go to **Windows Settings → Apps → Installed apps** and uninstall it. The uninstaller reverts all system changes made when enabling Xbox Mode and resets the Feature IDs to their default Microsoft-managed state.

On Legacy builds (`26100.7019` ~ `26100.8327` / `26200.7015` ~ `26200.8327`), this tool provides two screen dimensions override modes for Desktop PCs and Laptops — `PhysPanelCS` (default) and `PhysPanelDrv` (alternative).
